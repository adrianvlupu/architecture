<!-- TODO Improve this when the repo is structured more properly -->

In order to contribute to this repo you'll *need* to be familiar with the following:
- [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/): tool used to generate the diagrams
- The [C4 model](https://c4model.com): software architecture modelling technique
- [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and HTML

The repo contains:
- PlantUML (`.puml`) files for the main/initial idea (or idea 0) of the (new) architecture.
- `out` directory with all the generated images/files from _all_ `.puml` files in this repo (which are structured as per the directory structure and diagram names).
- `ideaX` directories which contain alternative architectural ideas.
