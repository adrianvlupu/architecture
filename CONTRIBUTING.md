# Contributing

In order to contribute to this repo you'll *need* to be familiar with the following:
- [PlantUML]: tool used to generate the diagrams (or the extension for your favourite editor/IDE).
- The [C4 model](https://c4model.com): software architecture modelling technique.
- [C4-PlantUML]: the combination of the above two (if you know the above two then this should be easy to pickup).
- [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

The repo is structured as follows:
- `src`: source directory where the C4-PlantUML diagrams and documentation reside.
  - `.puml` files: PlantUML diagrams that model various levels of architecture.
  - `.md` files: Markdown documentation attached to the respective diagram in the same directory.
- `docs`: resulting static website with the documentation (generated by `c4builder site`).

**Notes on using local images inside markdown files**
- They should be placed next to the markdown file using them.
- All of them will be copied over to the `docs` folder either in `/` (in the case of a single MD/PDF file) or following the same folder structure as in `src`, so make sure they have unique names.

## Setup
_Note: This requires [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)._
```bash
npm i -g c4builder
```

## Usage
 Generating the documentation website:
```bash
c4builder
```
- Locally serving the website (which will be accessible on http://localhost:3000):
```bash
c4builder site
```
